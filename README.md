# big-data-challenge : “Alexa, Can You Handle Big Data?”

In this project, the complete ETL process is performed on Big Data - completely in the cloud.

An AWS RDS instance is used, and PySpark is used within 2 separate Colab notebooks to extract, transform and load 2 datasets from https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt into a postgresql database.
